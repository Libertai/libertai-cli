//! Shared terminal RAII guard for the ratatui TUI.
//!
//! Both the main `code` TUI (`app.rs`) and the standalone `agents` TUI
//! (`agent_view.rs`) set up the terminal the same way — `enable_raw_mode`,
//! `EnterAlternateScreen`, build a `Terminal` — and need to undo all of that
//! on every exit path, including panics. [`TerminalGuard`] owns that teardown.
//!
//! The two callers differ in exactly one respect: `app.rs` enables mouse
//! capture during `run_loop` (so its guard must emit `DisableMouseCapture` on
//! drop), while `agent_view.rs` does not. That difference is captured by the
//! `restore_mouse` flag passed to [`TerminalGuard::new`].
